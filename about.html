     <br> <br>
    
            What makes us unique is that we develop our clothes with a few main factors in mind.
             <br> <br> Firstly, that the clothes look the part and ensure your child looks smart and ready to take on everything School has to throw at them.
             <br> <br> 
             Secondly, they are comfortable and actually enjoy being in the clothes as opposed to uncomfortable and irritable clothing that can distract them. 
               <br> <br>
               Lastly, the clothes are designed and built for endurance. 
            That’s AI uniform…</p>
